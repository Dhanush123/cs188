    A graph that keeps track of the computations performed by a neural network

    Each evaluation of the neural network (during both training and test-time)
    will create a new Graph. The computation will add nodes to the graph, where
    each node is either a DataNode or a FunctionNode.

    A DataNode represents a trainable parameter or an input to the computation.
    A FunctionNode represents doing a computation based on two previous nodes in
    the graph.

    The Graph is responsible for keeping track of all nodes and the order they
    are added to the graph, for computing gradients using back-propagation, and
    for performing updates to the trainable parameters.
